# Hello! 👋 I'm [Leynier Gutiérrez González](https://leynier.github.io) 👨🏻‍💻

> In this repo I maintain my site and blog using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material). They are available at [leynier.github.io](https://leynier.github.io).

I'm a Computer Science graduate. I know several programming languages such as C, C++, C#, Dart, Java, Python, and Javascript; in addition to other markup or style languages such as HTML, CSS, and JSON. I really like both mobile application development and web application development, using frameworks, software, technologies, etc; like Android Studio, Flutter, Unity, Flask, FastAPI, Vue.js, and Bootstrap.

In my free time, I am always researching and learning about new technologies, frameworks, etc. I am good at working both individually and as a team, I know the development methodologies of agile software and tools like Git.
